h1. TinySite overview

TinySite itself is a tiny (hence the name) pure Rack application, sporting a mere 130 LOC.

As already stated TinySite was designed with Heroku and Dropbox in mind. But of course TinySite will work at any other "Ruby":http://www.ruby-lang.org hoster as well and is easy to be self hosted (it's just "Rack":http://rack.rubyforge.org). And of course any other HTTP server or even local files will work for the content.

With the Heroku/Dropbox combination TinySite provides:

* Easy local editing of "YAML":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML & "Textile":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language) based _page content files_.
* Versioning of _page content files_.
* Give other people access to edit all pages or just some (via Dropbox folder sharing).
* Easy drag and drop image (and other asset) upload.
* Edit page form your iPhone or Android phone (via Dropbox edit app).
* An own Heroku subdomain (and it's cheap to register an own domain for it).
* Take full advantage of Herokus caching infrastructure.

So how does it work?
