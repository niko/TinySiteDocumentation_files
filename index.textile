h1. *TinySite*

*TinySite* is a small static site engine with "Heroku":http://heroku.com and "Dropbox":http://www.dropbox.com/ in mind. The idea is to host the app for a site on Heroku and take advantage of their awesome application stack and provide the static content via Dropbox.

For a guide to get you started immediately, go directly to the "installation and usage page":installation_and_usage. This documentation site is powered by *TinySite*. It may serve you as a blueprint for your own app.

If you like *TinySite* and don't have a Dropbox account already: Supporting this project by using my "Dropbox affiliate link":http://db.tt/zhjQbKF would be the easiest possibility to give back. And the best part is: When you use the affiliate link, not only me, but you too get 250MB extra space on Dropbox. If you do this and you'd like to be listed as a supporter just drop me a note.

If you use *TinySite* I'd love to refer to it in a (yet to be added) *TinySite in the wild* section.

*TinySite* is "on github.com":https://github.com/niko/TinySite and on "rubygems.org":https://rubygems.org/gems/tiny_site.
