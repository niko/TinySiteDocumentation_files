h1. *TinySite*

*TinySite* is a static small site engine with "Heroku":http://heroku.com and "Dropbox":http://www.dropbox.com/ in mind. The idea is to host the app for a site on Heroku and take advantage of their awesome application stack and provide the static content by Dropbox.

For a guide to get you started immediately, go directly to the "installation and usage page":installation_and_usage. This documentation app may serve you as a blueprint for your own app.

If you like *TinySite* and don't have a Dropbox account already: Supporting this project by using my "Dropbox affiliate link":http://db.tt/zhjQbKF would be the easiest possibility to give back. And the best part is: When you use the affiliate link, not only me, but you too get 250MB extra space on Dropbox.
