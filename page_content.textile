:title: The TinySite page content format
:description: Textile and YAML are the foundation of TinySites page content format.

++++body++++

h1. The *TinySite* page content format

... are based on a YAML header a several Textile body parts. A simple one would look like this:

<pre><code>---
:title: My Page
:description: It's uber-awesome!

++++sidebar++++ 

!some.png!

Orem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do
eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

++++body++++ 

h1. Hey, Dude!

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
</code></pre>[1]

This gives the layout access to these variables: @page[:title]@, @page[:description]@, @page['sidebar']@ and @page['body']@.

Analog to the @page@ variables the @global@ variables are set via the content of the @__global.textile@ file. A typical one would perhaps look like this:

<pre><code>---
:keywords: bla, blub, ...

++++navigation++++ 

* "Home":/
* "One":one
</code></pre>[1]

With this in place the layout has access to these variables: @global[:keywords]@ and @global['navigation']@. The @__global@ file would be the place to add a footer, too.

The filenames derive directly from the path. Subfolders are supported. With the above navigation in place you would need an @index.textile@ file and a @one.textile@ file next to your @__global.textile@ file.

Besides the @page@ and the @global@ variable the layout hast access to a @env@ hash containing the current path and the current query string: @env[:path]@ and @env[:query_string]@.

fn1. Note that I added a single whitespace to the end of the ++++variable++++ declaration lines to prevent *TinySite* from parsing the lines. If you copy the code you have to remove the whitespace.
