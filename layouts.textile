h1. The *TinySite* layouts

Each page is rendered into a "HAML":http://haml-lang.com layout file. The parts of the page and a set of variables are provided by the page itself and a _global content file_. The layout file should be located next to the rackup file @config.ru@ and defaults to @layout.haml@. The layout file is configurable via @page[:layout]@ and @global[:layout]@.

A minimal @layout.haml@ could look like this:

<pre><code>!!!
%html{:lang => "de"}
  %head
    %meta{:charset => "utf-8"}
    %title= page[:title] || global[:title]
    %link{:href => "/stylesheets/styles.css"}
  %body
    %header
    %h1 Some title
    %nav
      ~ global['navigation']
    %aside
      ~ page['sidebar']
    %section
      ~ page['body']
    %footer
</code></pre>[1]

Note the use of @page[:title]@, @global[:title]@, @global['navigation']@, @page['sidebar']@ and @page['body']@. These variables are defined via...

fn1. Also note the usage of @~@ as the HAML evaluation method. This prevents indentation. It's needed if you have code blocks (or other whitespace sensitive tags) in your Textile.
